# ðŸ“Š Task 6: Get Basic Sales Summary from a Tiny SQLite Database using Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The goal of this task is to connect Python with a small SQLite database, pull out sales information (like total quantity sold and total revenue), and visualize the results in a simple bar chart.

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- Python (for data processing and visualization)

- SQLite (lightweight database, used here in-memory for safety)

- Pandas (to handle data and run SQL queries easily)

- Matplotlib (to create bar charts)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

 - **sales_data :** [sales_data.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22251994/sales_data.csv)

The dataset (sales_data.csv) contains sales transactions with the following columns:

InvoiceNo â€“ Unique invoice number

StockCode â€“ Product stock identifier

Product â€“ Product name

Quantity â€“ Number of units sold

InvoiceDate â€“ Date of the transaction

UnitPrice â€“ Price per unit

CustomerID â€“ Unique customer identifier

Country â€“ Country of the customer

TotalPrice â€“ Calculated revenue (Quantity * UnitPrice)

## ðŸ”Ž Steps Performed

- Loaded the CSV file into Python using Pandas.

- Stored the dataset inside a fresh SQLite (in-memory) database.

- Ran an SQL query to calculate:

- Total quantity sold per product

- Total revenue per product

- Sorted the results by revenue and displayed the Top 10 products.

- Created a bar chart to visualize product revenues.

- Saved that bar chart as sales_data.png

## ðŸ“ˆ Output

- Chart: A bar chart showing the Top 5 Products by Revenue.
  
- Save The Chart : Saved the out put bar chart as sales_data.png
